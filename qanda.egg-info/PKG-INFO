        Background
        ----------
        
        Interactive command-line programs need to query users for information, be it
        text, choices from a list, or simple yes-or-no answers. *qanda* is a Python
        module of simple functions to prompt users for such information, with validation
        and cleanup of answers, allowing default responses, consistent formatting and
        presentation of help text, hints and choices. It is not a replacement for
        textual interfaces like curses and urwid, but intended solely for simple console
        scripts.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The simplest way to install *qanda* is via ``easy_install`` or an equivalent
        program::
        
        % easy_install qanda
        
        Alternatively the tarball can be downloaded, unpacked and ``setup.py`` run::
        
        % tar zxvf qanda.tgz
        % cd qanda
        % python set.py install
        
        *qanda* has no requisites and should work with just about any version of Python.

        hints="first name",
        default='Bar',
        )
        
        I need to know your friends name as well before I talk to you.
