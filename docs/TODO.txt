To do
=====

* Incorporate readline for better answer editing

* Examine multi-line text to make sure it actually works

* Auto range hints on Session.integer

* Better error messages for some validators - perhaps allow error message
  as a parameter?
  
* Some of questions have a very fat interface (a lot of options). While they're
  all optional, it's unclear that we're getting value of of these. Maybe more
  specialised simpler questions would do.
